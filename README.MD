بختصار كده انا عاوز اجيب نتيجه العيال اللي معايه بس مكسل ادور عليهم واحد واحد ...... فعملت سكريبت بيجبهم وخزن في 
Sqlite Database
fetchs the data from youm7 natiga website
(https://natega.youm7.com/)

I used Technologies like
  - PDO connection
  - cUrl
  - Simple_html_dom.php
  - Web scraping (tech)

> The database is (db.sqlite)
> The Main table called Students
> It contains many colums

# The Colums:-
  - name (the name of the student)
  - school (the school of the student)
  - manage (the District of the school)
  - fail (the number of subjects that the student failed)
  - status (the status of the student)
  - spz (the field the student specialized in (Arts, Maths, Bio))
  - number (the setting number of the student)
  - totalnumber (the total grade of the student)
  - per (the percentage of the student)
the data comes from youm7 website for the natiga (by web srcaping)
